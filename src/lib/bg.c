 *
 * Background task management.
 *
 * A background task is some CPU or I/O intensive operation that needs to
 * be split up in small chunks of processing because it would block the
 * process for too long if executed atomically.
 *
 * It can be thought of as a co-routine, its execution being done
 * alternatively with that of the calling routine, excepted that there
 * can be many such co-routines running concurrently in the same thread.
 *
 * Background tasks are inserted into schedulers, and these schedulers are
 * then explictly triggered to perform work.  A scheduler is given a time
 * slice to share with all the tasks that have been registered.
 *
 * There is a default scheduler which is invoked periodically by the main
 * callout queue.  Other threads may want to define their own scheduler
 * and configure it with large timeslices to perform the work more quickly.
 *
 * Each background task is defined by a set of steps to run, in sequence.
 * The scheduler provides an amount of "ticks" and the task should run its
 * processing for that many "ticks".  Of course, the value of a tick will
 * depend on the step being performed, and the scheduler constantly tries to
 * estimate the time cost for a tick to be able to dynamically adjust the
 * amount of requested ticks.
 *
 * Each step is a routine that can return four statuses:
 *
 * BGR_MORE to request that the scheduler continues to run this step
 * BGR_NEXT to request to move to the next step, if any
 * BGR_DONE to signal that the processing is completed and the task can exit
 * BGR_EXIT to indicate a fatal error and terminate the task immediately
 *
 * The background task is associated to a "user context", which is a structure
 * provided by the user code and which is passed along to each step. This is
 * the place to store global task information, to make sure each step can
 * stop its processing and resume it later, restarting at the same spot.
 *
 * A background task can be cancelled.  This will cause the BG_SIG_TERM to
 * be sent to the task, which it can trap. If it does not terminate explicitly,
 * it will be forcefully terminated upon return from this signal handler.
 * Cancellation is tested in the scheduler before and after each step, and
 * can also be explictly checked for by the task.
 *
 * When a task terminates (either by returning BGR_DONE, BGR_EXIT, calling
 * bg_task_exit(), being cancelled), there are two callbacks that are invoked
 * in order:
 *
 * - An optional "done" callback letting user code be informed that the task
 *   is being terminated.  It is given the background task handle, which is
 *   still valid at that stage and can be probed or acted upon via getters
 *   and setters.
 *
 * - An optional "context freeing" callback letting user code free-up the
 *   allocated context.  This callback only gets the context, not the task
 *   handle so it cannot access it unless it kept a copy of that task handle.
 *
 * Both callbacks are defined at task creation time.
 *
 * There is a special kind a background task, so-called a "daemon" task in
 * that, like a UNIX daemon, it waits for work to be added to wake up and
 * process it.  The daemon task is equipped with callbacks to start and end
 * processing of enqueued work items, as well as a free routine for these
 * work items.
 *
 * The difficult part of background tasks is that processing needs to be
 * sequential, and each step needs to be able to interrupt its processing at
 * any time and resume it at the next invocation.  Moreover, the context is
 * global to the processing, not lexically scoped as it would be if the
 * code was written as a set of routines and not as a big co-routine.  This
 * makes it more complex and tedious to write, but it gives nice multiplexing
 * in an execution thread for "heavy" computations.

/**
 * A "daemon" is a task equipped with a work queue.
 *
 * When the daemon is initially created, it has an empty work queue and it is
 * put in the "sleeping" state where it is not scheduled.
 *
 * As long as there is work in the work queue, the task is scheduled.
 * It goes back to sleep when the work queue becomes empty.
 *
 * The `steps' given represent the processing to be done on each item of
 * the work queue.  The `start_cb' callback is invoked before working on a
 * new item, so that the context can be initialized.  The `end_cb' callback
 * is invoked when the item has been processed (successfully or not).
 *
 * Since a daemon is not supposed to exit (although it can), there is no
 * `done' callback.
 *
 * @param bs			The scheduler to put task in (NULL = default)
 * @param name			Task name (for tracing)
 * @param steps			Work to perform (copied)
 * @param stepcnt		Number of steps
 * @param ucontext		User context
 * @param ucontext_free	Free routine for context
 * @param start_cb		Starting working on an item
 * @param end_cb		Done working on an item
 * @param item_free		Free routine for work queue items
 * @param notify		Start/Stop notify (optional)
 *
 * Use bg_daemon_enqueue() to enqueue more work to the daemon.
