This documents describes briefly the things we want to have in gtk-gnutella 
and which are not already implemented in SVN.

0.96.9
	* Full DHT GUI configuration / feedback.
	* Area-specific logging?
	* Disk space monitoring
	* Firewalled to firewalled transfers (when LimeWire publishes specs)
	* Keep track of long uptime ultrapeers
	* PARQ: PFS aware
	* PARQ: Tigertree aware
	* PARQ: 'Rotating' queue by filename?
	* Meta data support (locally)

Possible other changes
	* Smaller memory footprint by using sdbm for:
	  - PARQ?
	  - Host cache?
