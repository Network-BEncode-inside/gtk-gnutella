 * Condition waiting.
 *
 * A condition object is simply tracking how many threads are interested in
 * some event.  That event is not expressed in the condition itself but is
 * a predicate that each waiting party evaluates to determine whether they
 * need to continue waiting or whether they can proceed.
 *
 * One thread will at some point set the environment so that the predicate
 * can evaluate to true, and then it will be responsible for waking up
 * either one thread or all the waiting threads.
 *
 * Before waiting on a condition, a mutex needs to be held.  That mutex is
 * protecting the predicate.  Waiting will atomically register the thread
 * as waiting and will then of course release the mutex.  When a thread is
 * awaken, the mutex is grabbed again before exiting the waiting call.  Hence
 * from the thread's perspective, the waiting call is "transparent".
 *
 * When several threads are awoken by a broadcast, the predicate can become
 * false again before the thread gets a chance to evaluate it.  This is called
 * a "spurious wakeup".  Therefore, each waiting thread should wait using a
 * loop construct as outlined by this pseudo code:
 *
 *     <lock mutex>
 *     while (!<predicate>) {
 *         cond_wait(<cond>, <mutex>);
 *     }
 *     ... <predicate> now true, <mutex> is owned ...
 *     ... axe grinding ...
 *     <unlock mutex>
 *
 * The first cond_wait() done on a condition variable irremediably binds it
 * to that mutex.  Further callers will have to supply the same mutex or a
 * fatal error will occur.  Since it is necessary to hold the mutex whilst the
 * predicate is evaluated, the cond_wait() call cannot grab the mutex.
 *
 * The waking party must use the following code construct to avoid race
 * conditions:
 *
 *     <lock mutex>
 *     set <predicate> to true
 *     cond_signal(<cond>, <mutex>);	-- or cond_broadcast()
 *     <unlock mutex>
 *
 * Note the presence of the mutex in the cond_signal() call.  This enables
 * assertion checking, making sure this is the same mutex as the one used
 * by waiters, and that it is still held.  Since there can be some code after
 * the cond_signal() and before the release of the mutex, cond_signal() is
 * not taking care of releasing the mutex.
 *
 * Here is our API:
 *
 *		cond_init()       -- setup condition
 *		cond_wait()       -- wait
 *		cond_timed_wait() -- wait for some time
 *		cond_signal()     -- signals one waiter
 *		cond_broadcast()  -- signals all waiters
 *		cond_destroy()    -- destroy condition, waking all waiting threads
