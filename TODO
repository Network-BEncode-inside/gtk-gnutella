This documents describes briefly the things we want to have in gtk-gnutella 

0.96:	
	* Area-specific logging
	* Firewalled to firewalled transfers (when LimeWire publishes specs)
	* Tigertree support 					(JA: started)
	* HTTP chunked / unknown filesize support		(JA: started)
	* GUI: Add / remove of gwebcaches
	* Keep track of long uptime ultrapeers
	* PARQ: Update to 1.1 (to be specified)
	* PARQ: PFS aware
	* PARQ: Tigertree aware
	* PARQ: 'Rotating' queue by filename
	* Meta data support

After this release we should start with the gui <-> core/lib seperation.

Possible other changes
	* Smaller memory footprint by using sqlite for:
	  - PARQ
	  - Host cache

- Jeroen
