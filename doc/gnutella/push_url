                               PUSH URLs
                               =========

A PUSH URL is almost equivalent to an HTTP URL. The differences are
these:

 - A PUSH URL starts with "push://" instead of "http://".
 - The host is prefixed with the GUID of the target host. The GUID
   consists of 32 hexadecimal ASCII characters.  GUIDs are handled
   case-insensitively.
 - The host part does not describe the target host but a push-proxy
   thereof.


                                 Format
                                 ======

        push://<guid>:<host>:<port>/<path>


                                Examples
                                ========
        
        push://0123456789abcdef123456789abcdef:gnutella.example.com:6346/uri-res/N2R?urn:sha1:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


        push://0123456789abcdef123456789abcdef:127.0.0.1/path/file

        push://abababababababababababababababa:[::1]:6347/get/0/something.txt


                                 Usage
                                 =====

The push-proxy may be reachable over TCP or UDP. It is recommended to
contact the push-proxy first over UDP and fall-back to TCP after a
reasonable timeout.
