/**

 *
 * Minimal thread support.
 *
 * This mainly provides support for thread-private data, as well as minimal
 * thread tracking.
 *
 * It works by cooperation with the spinlock/mutex code that we're using,
 * providing hooks so that can detect the existence of new threads on the
 * fly and track them.
 *
 * We are not interested by threads that could exist out there and which never
 * enter our code somehow, either through a lock (possibly indirectly by
 * calling a memory allocation routine) or through logging.
