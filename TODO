This documents describes briefly the things we want to have in gtk-gnutella 
and which are not already implemented in SVN, by loose order of decreasing
priority.

0.97.1
	* Implement "IPv6-Ready" specifications.
	* DOVE extension for the DHT, adding IPv6 support and smarter publishing
	* Firewalled to firewalled transfers (reverse engineer LimeWire specs)
	* Configurable SOCKS usage: Gnutella connections, downloads and/or uploads.
	* Area-specific logging?
	* Disk space monitoring (~/.gtk-gnutella, download incomplete / complete)?
	* Keep track of long-running ultrapeers for faster startup after inactivity
	* PARQ: PFS aware
	* PARQ: Tigertree aware
	* PARQ: 'Rotating' queue by filename?
	* Meta data support (locally)

0.98
	* Optional gtk-gnutella clustering
	* Optional locale preferencing support

Possible other changes
	* Smaller memory footprint by using sdbm for:
	  - PARQ?
	  - Host cache?
