/**

 *
 * Sorting routines that do not call zalloc() or xmalloc().
 *
 * Most of this code comes from the GNU C library and was adapted by Raphael
 * Manfredi for inclusion into this library, mostly to remove all malloc()
 * dependency, strip libc internal dependencies, and reformat to our coding
 * standards.
 *
 * The excellent quicksort() implementation from Douglas C. Schmidt was further
 * optimized: maximize the chances of picking a good pivot when the partition
 * is large, optimize insertsort() when dealing with aligned items that are
 * multiples of words, detect an already sorted partition or one that is
 * almost-sorted to discontinue quicksort() and switch to insertsort() instead,
 * and better handle pathological inputs (all items equal).

 * Order size using quicksort.  This implementation incorporates

 *
 * 1. Non-recursive, using an explicit stack of pointer that store the

 *    of space required to store an array of SIZE_MAX is allocated on the
 *    stack.  Assuming a 32-bit (64 bit) integer for size_t, this needs
 *    only 32 * sizeof(stack_node) == 256 bytes (for 64 bit: 1024 bytes).
 *    Pretty cheap, actually.
 *
 * 2. Chose the pivot element using a median-of-three decision tree.
 *    This reduces the probability of selecting a bad pivot value and
 *    eliminates certain extraneous comparisons.
 *
 * 3. Only quicksorts TOTAL_ELEMS / MAX_THRESH partitions, leaving
 *    insertion sort to order the MAX_THRESH items within each partition.
 *    This is a big win, since insertion sort is faster for small, mostly
 *    sorted array segments.
 *
 * 4. The larger of the two sub-partitions is always pushed onto the
 *    stack first, with the algorithm then concentrating on the
 *    smaller partition.  This *guarantees* no more than log (total_elems)
 *    stack size is needed (actually O(1) in this case)!
