Coverity is a static code checker.

The gtk-gnutella project is at:

	https://scan.coverity.com/projects/2178

To build gtk-gnutella for analysis, one needs to first download the
necessary binaries for the platform, and install them say in /usr/local.
As of this writing, this is:

	/usr/local/cov-analysis-linux64-7.0.2

here on my machine.  Let's call this COV.

Add COV/bin to your PATH.

Configure your C compiler, for instance:

	cov-configure --compiler /usr/bin/cc --comptype gcc

In the src/ directory run:

	make realclean
	make depend
	mkdir cov-int		# name is hardwired in the Coverity tool chain
	cov-build --dir cov-int make gtk-gnutella.nm
	tar czvf gtk-gnutella.tgz cov-int

Upload the gtk-gnutella.tgz file to the Coverity scanner.

The file src/coverity.c is a model for the Converity scanner which teaches
it basic things about some key functions, for the runtime analyzing the code
paths.  The scanner may be able to automatically derive some of the properties
from gcc attribute hints, but maybe not, so we're helping it.
