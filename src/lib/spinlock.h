 *
 * Spinning locks.
 *
 * The API distinguishes between "regular" and "hidden" locks.  If a lock is
 * taken in "hidden" mode, it must be released in "hidden" mode as well.
 *
 * A "hidden" lock is not tracked at the thread level, and therefore does not
 * cause any memory allocation and is very fast.  A "regular" lock is tracked
 * at the thread level in a stack, and allows sanity checks to prevent any
 * out-of-order lock release, which can cause deadlocks later.
 *
 * In the advent a deadlock occurs, all the tracked locks owned by the thread
 * are dumped.  This means "hidden" locks never appear (hence the name).
 *
 * The locking API is made of three basic calls:
 *
 *		spinlock()		-- takes the lock, blocking if busy
 *		spinlock_try()	-- try to take the lock, returns whether lock was taken
 *		spinunlock()	-- releases the lock, which must be owned
 *
 * Each of these calls can be suffixed with _hidden to use "hidden" locks.
 * A lock is not inherently "hidden": this adjective refers to the way the
 * lock is taken.
 *
 * As a rule of thumb, "hidden" locks should be reserved to trivial low-level
 * locking that does not require any nested locking and which has but one lock
 * and one unlock statement, without much code in-between.  The rationale is
 * that we want outer critical section boundaries to be valid suspension points.
 *
 * For situations where critical sections must overlap (e.g. grab lock A,
 * then lock B, release A and then release B), one must use one of the
 * following routines:
 *
 *		spinlock_swap()		-- takes lock, then swap order of locks
 *		spinlock_try_swap()	-- try to take lock, swapping order
 *
 * To achieve the critical section overlap, one would do this:
 *
 *		spinlock(A);
 *		...
 *		spinlock_swap(B, A);	// the critical section overlap
 *		spinunlock(A);
 *		...
 *		spinunlock(B);
 *
 * The swapping allows to release locks in the reverse order, something that
 * the runtime normally forbids.
 *
 * When critical sections overlap, it is necessary to ensure that the locking
 * order will always be the same.  Otherwise, a deadlock could happen.
 *
 * The API also provided the following extra routine:
 *
 *		spinlock_is_held()	-- returns whether someone holds the lock
 *
 * When SPINLOCK_DEBUG is defined, each spinlock remembers the location that
 * initially grabbed the lock, which can be useful when debugging deadlocks.
