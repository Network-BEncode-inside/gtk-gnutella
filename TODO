This documents describes briefly the things we want to have in gtk-gnutella 
and which are not already implemented, by loose order of decreasing priority.

0.99
	* DOVE extension for the DHT, adding IPv6 support and smarter publishing
	* Firewalled to firewalled transfers (reverse engineer LimeWire specs)
	* Configurable SOCKS usage: Gnutella connections, downloads and/or uploads.
	* Disk space monitoring (~/.gtk-gnutella, download incomplete / complete)?
	* Keep track of long-running ultrapeers for faster startup after inactivity
	* PARQ: PFS aware
	* PARQ: Tigertree aware
	* PARQ: 'Rotating' queue by filename?
	* Meta data support (locally)

0.100
	* Optional gtk-gnutella clustering
	* Optional locale preferencing support
	* XML: Extraction of metadata for results sorting
	* XML: Filtering on metadata
	* XML: Generation of metadata in query hits
	* GUI display and sorting of A/V attributes (bitrate, video size)

Possible other changes
	* Smaller memory footprint by using sdbm for:
	  - PARQ?
	  - Host cache?
	* Area-specific logging?
