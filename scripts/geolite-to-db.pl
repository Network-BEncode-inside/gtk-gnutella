# Usage:
#
#	geolite-to-db.pl OUTPUT GeoLite2-Country-Blocks-IPvX.csv
#
# to generate the text database in OUTPUT, in a format suitable for
# gtk-gnutella consumption based on the CIDR country block description
# held in the CSV file (second argument).
#
# File GeoLite2-Country-Locations-en.csv contains locations:
#
#	174982,en,AS,Asia,AM,Armenia,0
#
# 174982 is the code used in other files to reference this location, and
# AM is the 2-letter ISO country code.
#
# File GeoLite2-Country-Blocks-IPv4.csv maps a CIDR range to a location.
# File GeoLite2-Country-Blocks-IPv6.csv maps a CIDR range to a location.
#
# Both files have entries such as:
#
# 	1.1.64.0/18,1861060,1861060,,0,0
#
# or
#
#	2001:470:5:4000::/50,6252001,6252001,,0,0
#
# What matters to us are the first two fields: the IP address and the location,
# but sometimes the location is missing in which case we have to use the 3rd
# field to get the region (for Europe apparently).
#
# There are also the cases of anonymizing proxies and satellite providers, which
# are identified by the last two fields (boolean values) in that order.
