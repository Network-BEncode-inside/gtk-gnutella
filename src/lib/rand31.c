/**
 * @ingroup lib
 * @file
 *
 * Simple Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG) engine.
 *
 * This engine should not be used when strong random numbers are necessary.
 * It is only meant to produce a simple source of randomness for tests, or
 * to bootstrap stronger engines.
 *
 * It generates 31-bit random numbers via an interface compatible with the
 * rand() C library function, only we append "31" at the tail to distinguish
 * rand31() from the standard routine, and also emphasize the limited range
 * of the random numbers we produce.
 *
 * When a sequence of random numbers yields an interesting result, it is
 * possible to replay it by querying the original random seed.  The only catch
 * is that the number 0 is not a valid seed for rand31_set_seed(), as it
 * requests the computation of a new random seed.  Given this PRNG is only
 * meant for tests and not for serious random numbers, this is not deemed a
 * problem, only bad luck.
 *
 * To (slowly) generate strong random numbers, use entropy_random().
 * For (faster) strong random nubers, use arc4random().
