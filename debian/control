Description: shares files in a peer to peer network
 Gtk-Gnutella is a reliable and efficient Gnutella client, supporting the
 latest Gnutella protocol, bandwidth limitation (both incoming and outgoing)
 traffic compression, and advanced search filters among other features.
 .
 Gnutella is a peer-based file-sharing protocol that allows a user
 running a Gnutella client to search for and download files from other
 Gnutella users, as well as share some files of his/her own.
 .
 Gtk-Gnutella offers all the extra features you expect from a modern client:
 persistent downloads, searches and filters, intuitive interface, upload
 statistics, queuing, and of course total control over many configuration
 parameters.
