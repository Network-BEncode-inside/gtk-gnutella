This version of sdbm merely has all the dbm_* names translated to sdbm_*
so that we can link ndbm and sdbm into the same executable.  (It also has
the bad() macro redefined to allow a zero-length key.)

Additional portability/configuration changes for libsdbm by Andy Dougherty
doughera@lafayette.edu.

sdbm_exists added to the library by Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>.

Taken out of the Perl 5.10.0 distribution in /ext/SDBM_File/sdbm by
Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com> and slightly adapted
for inclusion in gtk-gnutella.

The file sdbm.h was heavily edited to remove perl-isms, and the sdbm.c
file changed slightly to add gtk-gnutella-isms.

The standalone C programs do not compile as-is but were left to keep the
integrity of the original sdbm distribution.

Christian Biere brought up SDBM distribution to gtk-gnutella standards.

 * Prefixed all public SDBM macros with "DBM_".
 * Removed "register" keyword.
 * Removed unnecessary "(void)" in front of function calls.
 * struct DBM:
   * Keep implementation details hidden in sdbm.c.
   * Sorted members by size for compactness.
   * Allocate extra buffers for pagbuf and dirbuf
     because the code expects these to be aligned
     for "short int".
 * Replaced macros by (static inline) functions where possible.
 * Removed comma-operator. This should be reserved to macros
   or the like where it may be necessary and not used to save
   lines or look fancy.
 * sdbm_store(): val.dptr must be a valid pointer and non-NULL
   because the internal code uses memcpy() etc. without further
   checks.
 * Added sdbm_is_storable() to avoid integer overflows when
   calculating the required space.
 * sdbm_open():
   * Compose the filenames properly.
   * Additional file type and size checks.


Thu Aug 14 09:29:46 CEST 2008

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Fixed bug in getnext(), which flagged an I/O error when iterating over
  an empty database.
* Indented all comments within a function to match general gtk-gnutella style.
* Added trailing vi comments for VIM.


Wed Apr 29 23:58:57 CEST 2009

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Factorized page reading and flushing into fetch_pagbuf() and flush_pagbuf().
* All functions returning a boolean had their return type changed from int
  to gboolean to make that explicit.  Constants TRUE and FALSE replace 1 and 0.
* Protected getnext() against DB modifications during the key traversal. This
  is forbidden and will now trigger an assertion failure.
* Enhanced chkpage() to ensure ino[0] is always an even number and that offsets
  never point within the ino[] zone.
* Added sdbm_deletekey() to delete the current key during traversals.
* Added getnval() to get the n-th value from current page and sdbm_value() to
  return the current value during key iteration.
* Added sdbm_set_name() and sdbm_name(), for logging purposes.
* Call g_warning() unconditionally on low-level I/O errors to leave a trail
  when things start to go wrong.


Fri May  1 21:46:55 CEST 2009

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Modified dba's output to show the space used by keys and values, and to
  highlight pages with low free space (unable to add a new key/value pair,
  given the average size of the existing entries on the page).
* Added LRU page cache, activated via "tune.h".
* Added sdbm_set_cache() to tune the LRU cache size, sdbm_set_wdelay() to tune
  whether the cache should defer write operations (on non-important operations).
* Added sdbm_set_volatile() to flag the DB as not outliving an sdbm_close(),
  in which case even important bookkeeping operations can have their write
  deferred.
* Added statistics counters and final logging for:
  - amount of page reads and writes
  - amount of dir reads and writes
  - amount of block number hits for page and dir (accesses to current page)
  - amount of LRU page read cache hits (when LRU is activated)
  - amount of LRU page write cache hits (when LRU write-back is activated)
* Optimized seepair() slightly.


Tue Sep 22 22:27:36 CEST 2009

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Optimized sdbm_store(DBM_REPLACE) when the new value being written has the
  same size as the old value: the new value is written in-place without having
  to update anything else on the page.
* Enforce errno = 0 on sdbm_delete() for a non-existing key.
* Optimized sdbm_deletekey() to prevent reading the key.
* Added sdbm_replace() to update a possibly existing key and get to know
  whether the key existed or whether it was created.
* Whenever an I/O error occurs, put the database in read-only mode by denying
  further updates until they call sdbm_clearerr().
* In the advent of an I/O error during page splits, undo the operation and
  restore a consistent disk image, as if the last (incomplete) split had never
  been attempted.
* Smarter LRU page eviction in case we get an I/O error when flushing a dirty
  page: try to see whether we can reuse a slot from a clean page instead, to
  defer the time when we have no other choice but to raise an I/O error.
* Adapted dbu so that it can compile with the new sdbm library and can properly
  initialize the memory layer from gtk-gnutella's library, on which this
  version of sdbm relies.
* Added support for large keys and values, offloaded to an extra .dat file.
  The sum of key and value data cannot exceed 250 KiB, currently.  Large keys
  should be avoided if possible because they slow down lookups.


Fri Oct  2 19:18:47 CEST 2009

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Only turn database read-only after a write I/O error occurs.
* Added sdbm_shrink() to truncate files if trailing parts are empty.
* Added the "truncate" (aka "shrink") command to dbu and made "insert" work.

Thu Oct 14 00:21:01 CEST 2010

Changes from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>:

* Iterations through sdbm_firstkey() / sdbm_nextkey() now skip disk pages
  that can't be read for some reason.
* Added sdbm_clear() to remove all entries from the opened database.
* Added counter for corrupted pages, read and write errors, split write
  errors and unfixable split errors.
* Will now unconditionally emit warnings at SDBM close time if errors occurred
  during operations.
* Added sdbm_firstkey_safe() to activate additional checks during traversal,
  making sure all the keys belong to their page (i.e. that the .dir and .pag
  files are consistent), deleting all non-belonging keys.
