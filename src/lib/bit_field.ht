 *
 * Bit field (linear field of bits with fixed endiannes). 
 *
 * Macros defined here are derived from those in <lib/bit_aray.h> but
 * operate on a linear field of byte, with fixed endianness of bits
 * within each byte.
 *
 * This is intended to be used for portable representations of bit fields.
 * If used internally only, then bit_array_t should be preferred as it will
 * be more efficient computation-wise.
