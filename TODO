This documents describes briefly the things we want to have in gtk-gnutella 
and which are not already implemented in SVN, by loose order of decreasing
priority.

0.97:
	* Finish port to Windows.
	* HTTP request pipelining.
	* GUESS (Gnutella UDP Extension for Scalable Searches)
	* DHT GUI configuration (active / passive modes)
	* Remove dependency on libxml, switching to GTKG's own XML routines.
	* Write specifications for the DHT "NOPE" value.
	* Media type filtering.
	* Partial results requests.
	* "What's New?" queries.

0.97.1
	* DOVE extension for the DHT, adding IPv6 support and smarter publishing
	* Firewalled to firewalled transfers (reverse engineer LimeWire specs)
	* Area-specific logging?
	* Disk space monitoring (~/.gtk-gnutella, download incomplete / complete)?
	* Keep track of long-running ultrapeers for faster startup after inactivity
	* PARQ: PFS aware
	* PARQ: Tigertree aware
	* PARQ: 'Rotating' queue by filename?
	* Meta data support (locally)

Possible other changes
	* Smaller memory footprint by using sdbm for:
	  - PARQ?
	  - Host cache?
