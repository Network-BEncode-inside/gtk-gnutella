/**
 * @note NOTE:
 * It is the callers responsibility to ensure consistency between the file
 * descriptor and the pathname. Thus, this must not be used with arbitrary
 * paths but only for directories under our control.  For example, the file
 * could be removed by another process and file_object_open() would return the
 * file descriptor of the already removed file. When the last file object for
 * this pathname is released, the file contents would be lost.
 *
 * Likewise, you can open a file that has already been deleted or moved when
 * using file_object_open(). Whether the file still exists can be checked with
 * fstat(). However this is not necessarily the same file referenced by the
 * file object.
 *
 * The current offset is shared that means, you should always use pread()
 * instead of read(), pwrite() instead of write() etc. The replacement
 * functions -- compat_pread() and compat_pwrite() -- do not restore the
 * original file offset.
 *
 * The file objects created with O_RDWR are returned for all
 * file_object_open() requests. That means the caller must take care to not
 * accidently write to a file object acquired with O_RDONLY.
 *
 * Normally, file objects should be acquired as follows:
 *
 *  // Try to reuse an existing file object
 *  file = file_object_open(pathname, mode);
 *  if (!file) {
 *      int fd;
 * 
 *      // If none exists, create a new file object
 *      fd = open_the_file(pathname, mode);
 *      if (fd >= 0) {
 *      	file = file_object_new(fd, pathname, mode);
 *      }
 *      // Do not use fd directly, could have been closed/reused already
 *  }
 *  if (!file) {
 *     // Error handling
 *  }
 *
 * If a file object is created and released in the same function i.e., reuse
 * unlikely, the strictest access mode should be used (O_RDONLY or O_WRONLY).
 * Otherwise, it is best to use O_RDWR so that the same object can be reused
 * by further calls to file_object_open() whilst the object exists.
 *
 * This API does not allow opening the same file twice for compatible access
 * modes. You can create one file object for O_RDONLY and another with
 * O_WRONLY for the same path though, if none with O_RDWR exists.
