INTRODUCTION

An ultra node should be ideally positionned in the network: it must be
connected to well-connected ultra peers.  In order for an ultra node to
assess its connectivity, we are introducing an information exchange between
ultra nodes, allowing them to make sure they connected to "good" peers.

Indeed, in a network with high outdegree and low TTL, keeping a connection
with a poorly connected ultra node is not good for the "density" of the
network and not good for our leaves which have a lower search horizon.

Great care must be taken however to not peruse the information that can be
gathered through those messages to isolate poorly connected nodes.  That
would push them at the border of the network and never give them a chance
to become good peers.

SPECIFICATIONS

Those messages are meant to be used on a TCP connection to gather information
about connected peers.  However, they can also be sent via UDP in order for
UDP host caches to know which hosts can accept connections, for instance.

* Node Info Request

    Name: Node Info Request
    Vendor: GTKG
    ID: 22
    Version: 1
    TTL: 1
    Payload: (big-endian)
		uint32: flags

The flags are used to customize the reply that we wish to get, since some
of the fields are optional:

	0x00000001		include GGEP "DU" (daily average uptime) extension
	0x00000002		include GGEP "LOC" (locale) extension
	0x00000004		include GGEP "GTKG.IPV6" (IPv6 support) extension
	0x00000008		include GGEP "GTKGV1" (version info) extension
	0x00000010		include bandwidth information
	0x00000020		include TX/RX dropped packets information

* Node Info Reply

    Name: Node Info Reply
    Vendor: GTKG
    ID: 23
    Version: 1
    TTL: 1
    Payload: (big-endian represenation for multibyte values)
		char[4]: vendor code, e.g. { 'G', 'T', 'K', 'G' }
        byte: running mode (0 = auto, 1 = leaf, 2 = ultra)
		uint32: operating flags
        byte: max amount of ultra nodes
        byte: current amount of ultra nodes
        uint16: max amount of leaves
        uint16: current amount of leaves
	if (flags & 0x10) {
		byte: bandwidth flags
		uint16: Gnutella input b/w limit in KiB/sec (0 = none)
		uint16: Gnutella output b/w limit in KiB/sec (0 = none)
		uint16: Leaf input b/w limit in KiB/sec (0 = none)
		uint16: Leaf output b/w limit in KiB/sec (0 = none)
	}
	if (flags & 0x20) {
		uint32: dropped TX packets on this TCP connection
		uint32: dropped RX packets on this TCP connection
	}
		<optional GGEP block with requested information>

The operating flags are defined as:

	0x00000001			is TCP-firewalled
	0x00000002			is UDP-firewalled
	0x00000004			supports TLS connections
	0x00000008			is an ancient version
	0x00000010			time synchronized via NTP
	0x00000020			running headless as a server
	0x00000040			is DHT-capable

The bandwidth flags are defined as:

	0x01				uses strict b/w pools (no stealing of unused b/w)
	0x02				makes uses of IP TOS

The "Node Info Reply" should be sent like an "alive pong", i.e. with an urgent
priority (put ahead of the transmission queue) when replying through TCP.
