INTRODUCTION

An ultra node should be ideally positionned in the network: it must be
connected to well-connected ultra peers.  In order for an ultra node to
assess its connectivity, we are introducing an information exchange between
ultra nodes, allowing them to make sure they are connected to "good" peers.

Indeed, in a network with high outdegree and low TTL, keeping a connection
with a poorly connected ultra node is not good for the "density" of the
network and not good for our leaves which have a lower search horizon.

Great care must be taken however to not peruse the information that can be
gathered through those messages to isolate poorly connected nodes or to
create inordinate amounts of connection churns.  Every node deserves the
right to participate to the Gnutella network and be given a chance to
become a well-connected node.

The information gathered through UDP can also prove to be valuable for
researchers who study peer-to-peer networks and Gnutella in particular, to
assess the level of support of particular features, etc...

SPECIFICATIONS

Those messages are meant to be used on a TCP connection to gather information
about connected peers.  However, they can also be sent via UDP in order for
UDP host caches to know which hosts can accept connections, for instance.

The GUID of the Node Info Reply request is a copy of the one used in the
Node Info Request.  This allows the requester to know which of its requests
was finally processed (requests can be lost during UDP transport, or get
discarded by the flow-control of the Gnutella TCP connection).

The operating flags are defined as:

	0x00000001			is TCP-firewalled

	0x00000008			is an ancient version
	0x00000010			time synchronized via NTP
	0x00000020			running headless as a server
	0x00000040			is a passive member of the DHT

	0x00000400			will act as OOB proxy for leaves
	0x00000800			will deliver OOB replies

The answer flags is simply an echoing of the flags that were present in the
Node Info Request.  That way, the issuer of the request does not need to
remember the GUID of the request to recall which information it asked for.
Furthermore, if some information was requested but the node answering does
not know how to report that information, the corresponding bit is zero-ed.
In other words, the answer flags represents the information being returned
in the Node Info Reply.

The bandwidth flags are defined as:

	0x0001				uses strict b/w pools (no stealing of unused b/w)
	0x0002				makes uses of IPv4 TOS

The "Node Info Reply" should be sent like an "alive pong", i.e. with an urgent
priority (put ahead of the transmission queue) when replying through TCP.
